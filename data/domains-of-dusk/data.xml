	<description>
		A contemporary urban-mystical grand-strategy RPG, D.o.D. takes the genre's elements and streamlines them to facilitate meaningful roleplay. Players take the role of a Mage Club Founder, a Vampire Lord, a Warewolf Pack Alpha, a Head of a Unit of Hunters or a leader of any other faction of super-natural creatures, fighting for influence over a city. Turmoils within their ranks, opponent factions and trecherous allies won't make it easy.

		Set in real-world cities, narrative emergence, social critique and the development of the player's Leader Character are fostered through the interplay between the whims of realistic procedural characters, context-generated story events, deep diplomatic gameplay and socio-cultural urban simulation.

		All these invite rich replayability, endless content expansion possibilities, the comfort of contained playthroughs and multiplayer.
