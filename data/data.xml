	<histories>
		<history>
			<header>Dexter</header>
			<text>Andrei “Dexter” Olaru is the captain of Critique Gaming. An economist and career academic debater with international results, he’s the entrepreneurial spirit of the team, handling project and team management, wrangling needed resources.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Marius</header>
			<text>Marius Petcu studies in the Bucharest Polytechnic University. With artistic spirit and a background in academic debating, he’s the team’s programmer. He makes sure the abstract thoughts and ideas of the team take tangible form, supple and interactive on the player’s screen.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Moise</header>
			<text>Moise Theodor, master of numbers and papers, a human sized calculator of optimized business organization, he is the team’s business admin and our very own semi-pro e-sports player.
			</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>David</header>
			<text>David Moscovici has a master’s degree in law, is grumpy, is a trainer and career academic debater and is the team’s game designer. He writes the narrative content, insures the balance and dynamics of game mechanics and handles the creative direction of the games.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Dexi</header>
			<text>Dragos "Dexi” Antoniu Stoica is an Economics graduate but his soul is in music. Passionate about contemporary popular art, he creates the sounds and soundtracks for Critique Gaming as well as leading all marketing efforts.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Cătălin</header>
			<text>Amateur musician and video game enthusiast, Cătălin Nedeluș does not like waking up early. However, he is like fish in the water when it comes to game development.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Mădălina</header>
			<text>Completing our art team, Mădălina Șoimu is a Computer Science student. She has a knack for smart video games and for drawing art for them.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Cristian</header>
			<text>Easily confessing his love of life, Cristian is a Computer Science graduate that seeks the light in RPG games, indie games and programming.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Alex</header>
			<text>With a dual degree in screenwriting and psychology, Alex enjoys creating interesting and life-like characters above all. His pastimes include writing in a supine position, yelling at a TV screen whenever Liverpool plays, and ranting about pop culture.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Victor</header>
			<text>A renegade Law school graduate, Victor Bajan does what any good narrative content writer does: he stresses about the lore for 12 hours and writes 10 pages of dialogue in 2. He has a passion for worldbuilding and really, really cares about consistency.</text>
		</history>
		<history>
			<header>Vlad</header>
			<text>A Masters graduate in fine arts, Vlad has had a fascination in games ever since he was cowering behind his parents as they played Doom 2 on a beige, old Pentium PC. If it's not subversive, hot blooded, ambitious, or painfully mid-2000's edgy, Vlad doesn't want to have anything to do with it.</text>
