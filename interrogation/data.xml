	<description>
	Interrogation is a narrative game that emulates the atmosphere of dark investigation procedurals to put the player in the detective’s seat and challenge their preconceptions with noire intensity. The game is intended to emulate the tropes related to interrogation scenes in pop-culture while also offering some deconstruction. It plays as a questions-based puzzle in which the player must manage the emotions of suspects and interpret information into discovering details about future terrorist attacks.
	</description>

	<history>
	Interrogation came up at the Amberjam 2016, at the Eastern European Comic-Con in Bucharest. (Game Jams are competitions in which developers try to create a game from scratch within 24 hours). Given the theme “Under the surface”, we decided to take a metaphorical approach, and look under the surface of people: what people try to hide. Knowing that, and that we also want exciting and engaging gameplay, the solution we arrived to was making an interrogation game: Putting the player in the seat of the inquisitor that needs answers fast and that needs to decide what corners to cut. Building tension and atmosphere were key, as was having characters with realistic psychological nuance.
